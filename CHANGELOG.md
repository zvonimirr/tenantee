# Changelog

## 0.4.0
`0.4.0` is a complete rewrite that ditches React and focuses solely on Phoenix. 
Reasons for that are explained in [#391](https://github.com/zvonimirr/tenantee/pull/391), and some features were cut for the time being, but will likely
be added again shortly. The core functionality was kept (manage properties, tenants and rents).

But, there are some other changes as well:
- Rental agreements can be generated for properties ([@mrahmatu](https://github.com/mrahmatu))
- Preferences (now called configs) are stored in Redis ([@zvonimirr](https://github.com/zvonimirr))
- Replaced Oban with Quantum for cron-jobs ([@zvonimirr](https://github.com/zvonimirr))
- Rents and communication channels are managed from their own pages ([@zvonimirr](https://github.com/zvonimirr))
- Configuration is forced before adding properties, tenants etc. ([@zvonimirr](https://github.com/zvonimirr))
- Deployment guides for AWS and Fly.io ([@zvonimirr](https://github.com/zvonimirr) and [@lukaevet](https://github.com/lukaevet))
