## Bug reporting
Did you encounter any bugs while using the application?

If so, please open a [issue](https://github.com/zvonimirr/tenantee/issues) and add the proper labels alongisde the `bug` label.

If you encountered a bug in the frontend part use the `frontend` label.

If the bug is found in the API use the `backend` label.

Describe the bug in most detail as possible and if you can tell us how to reproduce it.

Providing more info such as OS, browser version, Elixir version etc. is also highly recommended as it helps us pin the bug easier.

## Feature requests
Tenantee is a more than happy to expand it's line of features if they make sense.

If you wish to request a new feature please to do so by opening an issue and adding the `feature request` label.

Explaining why adding the feature would benefit the project is a great way to ensure your request gets taken more seriously.

## Pull requests
Whilst anyone can open a pull request the best course of action is to wait until you're given a green light to work on an issue.

If you want to add a new feature please open an issue first.

This saves both the maintainer's and the contributor's time.

Pull requests that are related to adding new features should include tests. (Along with Swagger docs if working on the API)

If adding any new dependencies make sure the license if compatible with GPLv3.

Don't forget to add yourself to the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).
